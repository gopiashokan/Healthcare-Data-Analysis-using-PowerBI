**Features**

#### Visit Trends and Patterns:

   - **Daily Visits:** The daily visitor trend shows a gradual increase from the start of each month, peaking towards the end, and then dropping on the last day. This suggests a higher influx of visitors in the final week of every month.

   **Monthly Visits:** April to October saw an increase in visitor counts, with the summer and rainy seasons bringing more visits, suggesting seasonal effects on hospital traffic.
   
   - **Yearly Visits:** Visitor counts rose by **5.8%** from 2019 to 2020, indicating either an increase in health issues or greater trust in the hospital‚Äôs services.

   - **Quarterly Visits:** The second and third quarters showed **53.9%** higher visitor volumes than the first and fourth quarters, reflecting busier mid-year periods.


#### Time-Based Distribution:

   - **Moment Distribution:** Visitor flow is almost evenly split between AM and PM, with a marginal **0.6%** increase in visits during AM hours. This suggests that the hospital experiences steady demand throughout the day, possibly due to a balanced distribution of appointments and walk-ins across morning and afternoon hours.
   
   - **Day of Week Distribution:** The highest visitor volumes are seen on Mondays and Wednesdays, while Friday sees the lowest count of the week. This pattern indicates a mid-week peak in hospital visits, which might relate to scheduling preferences or a greater need for medical attention earlier in the week.
   
   - **Weekday vs. Weekend:** Weekday visits are **148.83%** higher than on weekends, reflecting a significant increase in weekday traffic. This large difference could be due to fewer staff or reduced operating hours on weekends, encouraging most visitors to seek medical services during the workweek.


#### Visitor Wait Time Analysis:

   - **Average Wait Time:** On average, visitors wait about 35 minutes, with **90.9%** experiencing waits between 20 to 60 minutes, indicating an area for potential process improvement.
   
   - **Short Wait Times:** Only **9.1%** of visitors experience shorter wait times(10-20 mins), highlighting an opportunity to enhance service speed.


#### Demographic Insights:

   - **Age Group Distribution:** Visitors of all ages (0 to 75) show similar frequency, while the 75+ age group represents only **5.04%**, possibly reflecting either fewer visits or a smaller population.
   
   - **Race Distribution:** White and African American visitors make up the majority, followed by Asians at a moderate count, with Pacific Islander and Native American groups at around 10% combined.
   
   - **Gender Distribution:** Male visitors are slightly higher in count by **4.86%** compared to females, with "Not Specified" making up a minimal **0.26%**.


#### Satisfaction and Departmental Insights:

   - **Satisfaction Score Distribution:** The average satisfaction score is **5 out of 10**, indicating that most visitors have a neutral or average perception of the services, showing room for quality improvement.

   - **Department Referrals:** General Practice and Orthopedics account for **30.75%** of all referrals, while non-referred (walk-in) cases are high at 58.67%.

   - **Admin Flag Distribution:** **50.04%** of visitors are fully registered patients, suggesting that the remaining **49.96%** are likely visitors or individuals not yet registered for treatment.
