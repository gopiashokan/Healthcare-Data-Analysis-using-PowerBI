# Healthcare Data Analysis using Power BI


**Introduction**

Analyze healthcare data effectively using Power BI to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. This project explores patient demographics, visit trends, and satisfaction scores, providing a comprehensive view of hospital performance over time. By leveraging DAX functions and interactive dashboards, it highlights crucial areas for quality improvement and resource allocation, empowering data-driven decisions in healthcare management.

**Features**

#### Visit Trends and Patterns:

   - **Daily Visits:** The daily visitor trend shows a gradual increase from the start of each month, peaking towards the end, and then dropping on the last day. This suggests a higher influx of visitors in the final week of every month.

   - **Monthly Visits:** From April to October, there was a noticeable increase in visitor counts, particularly during the summer and rainy seasons. This trend indicates that seasonal factors significantly impact hospital traffic.
   
   - **Yearly Visits:** The Visitor counts increased by **5.8%** from 2019 to 2020, suggesting either an increase in health issues or growing trust in the hospital‚Äôs services. This rise may reflect both higher demand for healthcare and improved patient satisfaction.

   - **Quarterly Visits:** The second and third quarters exhibited visitor volumes that were **53.9%** higher than the first and fourth quarters. This indicates that mid-year periods are busier, potentially due to seasonal illness peaks.


#### Time-Based Distribution:

   - **Moment Distribution:** Visitor flow is almost evenly split between AM and PM, with a marginal **0.6%** increase in visits during AM hours. This suggests that the hospital experiences steady demand throughout the day, possibly due to a balanced distribution of appointments and walk-ins across morning and afternoon hours.
   
   - **Day of Week Distribution:** The highest visitor volumes are seen on Mondays and Wednesdays, while Friday sees the lowest count of the week. This pattern indicates a mid-week peak in hospital visits, which might relate to scheduling preferences or a greater need for medical attention earlier in the week.
   
   - **Weekday vs. Weekend:** Weekday visits are **148.83%** higher than on weekends, reflecting a significant increase in weekday traffic. This large difference could be due to fewer staff or reduced operating hours on weekends, encouraging most visitors to seek medical services during the workweek.


#### Visitor Wait Time Analysis:

   - **Average Wait Time:** On average, visitors wait about 35 minutes, with **90.9%** experiencing waits between 20 to 60 minutes, indicating an area for potential process improvement.
   
   - **Short Wait Times:** Only **9.1%** of visitors experience shorter wait times(10-20 mins), highlighting an opportunity to enhance service speed.


#### Demographic Insights:

   - **Age Group Distribution:** Visitors of all ages (0 to 75) show similar frequency, while the 75+ age group represents only **5.04%**, possibly reflecting either fewer visits or a smaller population.
   
   - **Race Distribution:** White and African American visitors make up the majority, followed by Asians at a moderate count, with Pacific Islander and Native American groups at around 10% combined.
   
   - **Gender Distribution:** Male visitors are slightly higher in count by **4.86%** compared to females, with "Not Specified" making up a minimal **0.26%**.


#### Satisfaction and Departmental Insights:

   - **Satisfaction Score Distribution:** The average satisfaction score is **5 out of 10**, indicating that most visitors have a neutral or average perception of the services, showing room for quality improvement.

   - **Department Referrals:** General Practice and Orthopedics account for **30.75%** of all referrals, while non-referred (walk-in) cases are high at 58.67%.

   - **Admin Flag Distribution:** **50.04%** of visitors are fully registered patients, suggesting that the remaining **49.96%** are likely visitors or individuals not yet registered for treatment.
