# Healthcare Data Analysis using Power BI


**Introduction**

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key trends and patterns in hospital visitor data. By utilizing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for in-depth calculations, we offer actionable insights that support informed decision-making in the healthcare sector. The analysis focuses on enhancing the patient demographics and service utilization, ultimately improving operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. Through effective data visualization, the project empowers healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions that enhance patient care and optimize resource management.

**Features**

#### Visit Trends and Patterns:

   - **Daily Visits:** The daily visitor trend shows a gradual increase from the start of each month, peaking towards the end, and then dropping on the last day. This suggests a higher influx of visitors in the final week of every month.

   - **Monthly Visits:** From April to October, there was a noticeable increase in visitor counts, particularly during the summer and rainy seasons. This trend indicates that seasonal factors significantly impact hospital traffic.
   
   - **Yearly Visits:** The Visitor counts increased by **5.8%** from 2019 to 2020, suggesting either an increase in health issues or growing trust in the hospital’s services. This rise may reflect both higher demand for healthcare and improved patient satisfaction.

   - **Quarterly Visits:** The second and third quarters exhibited visitor volumes that were **53.9%** higher than the first and fourth quarters. This indicates that mid-year periods are busier, potentially due to seasonal illness peaks.


#### Time-Based Distribution:

   - **Moment Distribution:** Visitor flow is evenly split between AM and PM hours, with a slight **0.6%** increase during AM visits. This indicates steady demand throughout the day, likely from a mix of appointments and walk-ins.
   
   - **Day of Week Distribution:** Visitor volumes peak on Mondays and Wednesdays, while Fridays have the lowest counts. This suggests a mid-week preference for hospital visits, possibly due to increased medical needs.
   
   - **Weekday vs Weekend:** Weekday visits are **148.83%** higher than weekends, reflecting significant weekday traffic. This large difference is due to fewer staff or reduced hours on weekends, encouraging visits during the week.


#### Visitor Wait Time Analysis:

   - **Average Wait Time:** On average, visitors wait about 35 minutes, with **90.9%** experiencing waits between 20 to 60 minutes. This indicates a significant area for potential process improvement in reducing wait times.
   
   - **Short Wait Times:** Only **9.1%** of visitors experience shorter wait times of 10 to 20 minutes. This low percentage highlights a clear opportunity to enhance service speed and overall patient satisfaction.


#### Demographic Insights:

   - **Age Group Distribution:** Visitors of all ages (0 to 75) show similar frequency, while the 75+ age group constitutes only **5.04%**. This may reflect either fewer visits or a smaller demographic within this age range.
   
   - **Race Distribution:** White and African American visitors comprise the majority, with Asians at a moderate count. Pacific Islander and Native American groups together account for **11.37%**, reflecting a diverse patient population.
   
   - **Gender Distribution:** Male visitors outnumber females by **4.86%**, while the "Not Specified" category represents a minimal 0.26%. This slight gender disparity highlights the need for targeted engagement strategies.


#### Satisfaction and Departmental Insights:

   - **Satisfaction Score Distribution:** The average satisfaction score is **5 out of 10**, indicating that most visitors have a neutral or average perception of the services, showing room for quality improvement.

   - **Department Referrals:** General Practice and Orthopedics patients account for **30.75%**, while other departments, including Physiotherapy and Cardiology, represent **10.64%**. Notably, non-referred patients constitute a substantial **58.67%** of total visitors.

   - **Admin Flag Distribution:** **50.04%** of visitors are fully registered patients, while **49.96%** are either visitors or individuals not registered for treatment. This indicates a significant portion of the hospital's traffic consists of non-registered individuals.
